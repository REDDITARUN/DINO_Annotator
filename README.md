This repository contains tools to automate image annotation using Grounding DINO, streamlining your projects in AI and machine learning.

## Introduction

GroundingDINO is a powerful tool for efficient open-set object detection. By leveraging its capabilities, you can accelerate your image annotation process, making it more efficient and effective.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- An image dataset structured in the following format:
```
/image dataset directory
...../cars
........./image1.jpg, image2.jpg, ...
...../bikes
........../image1.jpg, image2.jpg, ...
```
If you don't have an image dataset, you can create your custom dataset using SnapShift. Learn more [here](https://medium.com/@teendifferent/stop-wasting-time-scraping-images-get-snapswift-your-python-bing-downloader-dc7ac9e2c6c7), [Github](https://github.com/REDDITARUN/Snap_Swift).
